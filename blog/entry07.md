### Content
So now, we have finished out freedom project and had made an elevator pitch. An elevator pitch is like an a presentation where you sit down and people come to look at your project. You talk about your topic and parts in your website. For example, I had talked about graphic arts and my tool A-frame. I also included how graphic arts has aged throughout these years and new inventions that I had created. I also showed them my code. But, I still have a few takeways about the elevator pitch.

* **Being prepared** (This was important because by the time we were about to present out presentation and our projects, I had not finished my script yet for my elevator pitch. So, I had to finish it before the judges came and remembered the script.
* **Being more exited** (I was definetly a little nervous so I had sounded a little boring. So I think next time, I should give more energy when presenting.)

We also had in-class presentations. We presenting to different people in our class to be more prepared. But, I still have a few takeaways that I could inprove in.

* **Take my time** (Although I had only 1 minute to present and 30 seconds for questions, I went through it really fast amd actually had time to spare. I could have talked more about different parts of my website but I was rushing because I had 1 minute.)
* **Color choices** (This was something I could have added to my presentation.)
* **Clarity** (I could have been more clear when presenting but I was nervous talking to new people.)
