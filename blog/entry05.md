### Context
I chose the tool A-Frame for my freedom project. A-Frame is a virtual reality scene.

### Content
I was able to learn my tool from the [A-Frame website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/writing-a-component.html). I was able to learn about the components on the website. The website includes examples. I learned that A-Frame is like a virtual reality where you can look around in a 360 image. I also watched a video on A-Frame to help my understanding of A-Frame and how it works. I learned how to use the `<a-scene>` tag and how elements are build inside it. Inside the `<a-scene>` tags, are where you will be building your shapes. You are able to change the background color, and the color of your shapes. You are also able to change your camera view, depending on where you want to be looking at. I was able to learn and tinker with A-Frame on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sequoia-nostalgic-hole?path=index.html%3A16%3A25). 

It starts me off with this code:

Here is the code has created/the preview:

This is html, so I am able to understand how everything has been made. I tinker by changing the positionings of the shapes and the color of the shapes. I also replaced the sphere with a cone as shown below.

### Engineering Design Process 
I am currently building a prototype. I started off with some A-Frame starter code where I am able to edit the code. I learned that I am able to change the positioning, add shapes, add colors, and change the background. This helps me understand the structure of my code. So, that's what I did to tinker. My next steps are to build a more complex version that can be used for my freedom project.

### Skills
I have been able to learn many skills. One skill I have developed through this was how to read, because by reading through the [A-Frame website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/installation.html), I was able to figure out how to use the components and shapes and add them into code. Another skill I have strengthened was how to learn. By observing through some starter code, I am able to put together how each conponent made each shape in the preview.
