### Context
I chose the tool A-Frame for my freedom project. 

### Content
I was able to learn my tool from the [A-Frame website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/writing-a-component.html). I was able to learn about the components on the website. The website includes examples. I learned that A-Frame is like a virtual reality where you can look around in a 360 image. I also watched a video on A-Frame to help my understanding of A-Frame and how it works.
