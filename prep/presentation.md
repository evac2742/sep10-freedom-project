# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Imagine turning your ideas into art on any device, anywhere you go.
  
## Product
* Website product overview
* Highlight the 3 main sections (Before Technology, Current technology, and Future technology)

## Process
* Part A and part B overview with images of my wireframes.
* Code snippets
* Tool learning
* CSS and HTML
* A-Frame

## Conclusion
* URL to project
* Takeaways: Design is storytelling.
Every layout decision shapes how people experience your message.
* Determination is key: Fixing bugs on your website
* Design is trial and error: You may make mistakes throughout the process.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
